Developed for Game Dev Hackathon

Your goal is to score as many points as you can.

Points can be scored by killing enemy, collecting coins and power-ups.

Avoid touching the enemy aur it's projectile, as getting hit will result in Game Over!!
Powerup grants you with a projectile that can be used once. On getting hit by the projectile the enemy will die,
and a new one will respawn somewhere else.
As your score increases, the game difficulty will increase,i.e., attacks of the enemy will be faster,
and also enemies will run faster.
